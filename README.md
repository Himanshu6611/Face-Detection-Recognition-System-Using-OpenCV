# Face-Detection-Recognition-System-Using-OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV to perform real-time face detection and recognition through a webcam. It captures face samples, trains an LBPH model, and verifies identities by matching live faces with stored images. The system supports dataset creation, model training, and accurate person verification.
